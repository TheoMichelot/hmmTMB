Description: Fitting hidden Markov models using automatic differentiation 
  and Laplace approximation, allowing for fast inference and flexible covariate
  effects (including random effects and smoothing splines) on model parameters.
  The package is described by Michelot (2025) <doi:10.18637/jss.v114.i05>.
