\title{hmmTMB: Fit Hidden Markov Models using Template Model Builder}
\description{
Fitting hidden Markov models using automatic differentiation and Laplace approximation, allowing for fast inference and flexible covariate effects (including random effects and smoothing splines) on model parameters.
}
\details{
The package hmmTMB is based on three main classes (i.e., types of objects):
MarkovChain, Observation, and HMM. Type ?MarkovChain, ?Observation or ?HMM
to find their documentation, or consult the package vignettes for detailed
examples of the hmmTMB workflow.
